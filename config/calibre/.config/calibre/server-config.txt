# Password based authentication to access the server
# Normally, the server is unrestricted, allowing anyone to access it. You can restrict access to predefined users with this option.
auth True
# The port on which to listen for connections
port 8081
# Allow un-authenticated connections from specific IP addresses to make changes
# Normally, if you do not turn on authentication, the server operates in read-only mode, so as to not allow anonymous users to make changes to your calibre libraries. This option allows anybody connecting from the specified IP addresses to make changes. Must be a comma separated list of address or network specifications. This is useful if you want to run the server without authentication but still use calibredb to make changes to your calibre libraries. Note that turning on this option means anyone connecting from the specified IP addresses can make changes to your calibre libraries.
