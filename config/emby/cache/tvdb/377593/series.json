Blige as well as several members of the original \"Power\" cast, a prequel and two spin-off sequels have also been greenlit.\r\n\"Power Book III: Raising Kanan\" is the prequel story that takes viewers back to the '90s and the early years of iconic \"Power\" character Kanan Stark.\r\n\"Power Book IV: Influence\" will follow Rashad Tate (played by Larenz Tate) in his ruthless pursuit of political power.\r\n\"Power Book V: Force\" will take fans on a ride-along with Tommy Egan (played by Joseph Sikora) after he cuts ties and puts New York in his rearview mirror for good.","url":"power","isOfficial":true,"nameTranslations":["eng","pt"],"overviewTranslations":["eng"],"aliases":[],"score":0},{"id":7190,"name":"Trakt Library","overview":"","url":"7190","isOfficial":false,"nameTranslations":["eng"],"overviewTranslations":["eng"],"aliases":[],"score":0},{"id":13605,"name":"All MarMar Shows ","overview":"","url":"13605","isOfficial":false,"nameTranslations":["eng"],"overviewTranslations":["eng"],"aliases":[],"score":0}],"remoteIds":[{"id":"10.5240/E29B-AB96-E60D-13A6-0382-R","type":13,"sourceName":"EIDR"},{"id":"ForceStarz","type":5,"sourceName":"Facebook"},{"id":"tt11761194","type":2,"sourceName":"IMDB"},{"id":"forcestarz","type":9,"sourceName":"Instagram"},{"id":"119845","type":12,"sourceName":"TheMovieDB.com"},{"id":"forcestarz","type":6,"sourceName":"X (Twitter)"}],"characters":[{"id":65951501,"name":"Tommy Egan","peopleId":256310,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/256310/photo/625b64e98e0d8.jpg","sort":1,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/256310-joseph-sikora","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Joseph Sikora","personImgURL":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/256310/photo/620db10b5a505.jpg"},{"id":65951502,"name":"Diamond","peopleId":474523,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/474523/photo/6211401c9a0fd.jpg","sort":2,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/474523-isaac-keys","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Isaac Keys"},{"id":65951503,"name":"Claud Flynn","peopleId":395045,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/395045/photo/62113ff0d7025.jpg","sort":3,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/395045-lili-simmons","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Lili Simmons","personImgURL":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/395045/photo/65034130ac2f7.jpg"},{"id":65951504,"name":"Vic Flynn","peopleId":503520,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/503520/photo/6216d3d25d427.jpg","sort":4,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/503520-shane-harper","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Shane Harper","personImgURL":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/503520/photo/64bc8779acfde.jpg"},{"id":65951505,"name":"D-Mac","peopleId":7915853,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/7915853/photo/626158669c801.jpg","sort":10,"isFeatured":false,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/7915853-lucien-cambric","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Lucien Cambric"},{"id":65951506,"name":"Walter Flynn","peopleId":473029,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/473029/photo/62216e90ec0b5.jpg","sort":6,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/473029-tommy-flanagan","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Tommy Flanagan","personImgURL":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/473029/photo/67abf9fced425.jpg"},{"id":65951507,"name":"Jenard","peopleId":524960,"seriesId":377593,"type":3,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/actor/524960/photo/6216d7645efb5.jpg","sort":7,"isFeatured":true,"url":"https://thetvdb.com/people/524960-kris-d-lofton","peopleType":"Actor","personName":"Kris D.
